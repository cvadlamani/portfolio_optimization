# Binary Optimization for Portfolio Selection

This repository contains code to perform binary optimization on a portfolio of 5 stocks, selecting an optimized subset of 3 stocks. 

## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install IPython
pip install --upgrade "qci-client<5"
```
## Python Version

Ensure you are using the appropriate Python version (3.8 or higher) that is compatible with the dependencies listed above.



## QCI Client and API Token

To use the QCI Client, you need to have an API token. Make sure you have your API token ready and set up in the environment.

## File and Method Descriptions

### parameters.py

This file contains the parameters used for the optimization process, such as the number of in-sample and out-of-sample days.

### get_stock_returns.py

Contains the method `get_stock_returns` which retrieves stock return data for the specified time periods.

### get_hamiltonian.py

Contains the method `get_hamiltonian` which constructs the Hamiltonian matrix used to balance returns and risks.

### optimize_portfolio.py

Contains the method `optimize_portfolio` which uses the Hamiltonian matrix to find the optimal set of stocks.

## Parameters Description

- **IN_SAMPLE_DAYS**: Number of days used for in-sample data.
- **OUT_OF_SAMPLE_DAYS**: Number of days used for out-of-sample data.

## Path Files

Make sure the paths to the CSV files containing the stock data are correctly specified in your code. For example:

```python
file_path = r"C:\\Users\\Chitra Vadlamani\Desktop\\portfolio_optimization_repo\\company_stock_data.csv"
```
